*** ***INSTRUCTIONS to run the code*** ***

*STEP-1* : Mount your Google Drive locally by using drive folder location.

*STEP-2* : Set your own INPUT and OUTPUT directories.

*STEP-3* : Run each section one after one.(Each execution results in one output only.)

*STEP-4* : Set "plot_image = True" if you want to plot all images during execution.
 
 => See the test_data, Output folders to check the input, output sample.
